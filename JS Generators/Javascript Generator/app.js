/*a generator is just a function that is used to iterate over a series of values.

/* When you call a generator function it doesnâ€™t actually run any of the code in the generator and instead returns a generator object which can be used to run the code in the generator function. */

const generatorObject = simpleGenerator();
/* With a generator object we have the ability to run the code in the generator step by step from one yield to the next yield by using the next function */
console.log(generatorObject.next());
// { value: 1, done: false }

/* In the above example you can see we created a generator object and called next 4 different times. Each time we called next it returned an object that contained a value property which is the value passed to the next yield as well as a done boolean that determined if we were at the end of the generator. */
