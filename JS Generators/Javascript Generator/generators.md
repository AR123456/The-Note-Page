JavaScript generators are a unique feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allow you to create iterators in a more concise and flexible way. Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, making it possible to produce a series of values over time, on-demand, instead of generating all the values at once. This ability to pause and resume execution gives generators their power and versatility
To create a generator, you use the function\* syntax (notice the asterisk after the function keyword). Within a generator function, you can use the yield keyword to produce a value and pause the function's execution. When the generator is called again, it continues from where it left off.
Generators are useful in scenarios where you want to generate a large number of values or perform asynchronous operations sequentially. They provide a cleaner and more readable way of handling complex flows that involve pausing and resuming functions.

Keep in mind that generators are not automatically executed like regular functions. When you call a generator function, it returns a generator object. You can then use this object to control the execution of the generator and retrieve values using the next() method.
