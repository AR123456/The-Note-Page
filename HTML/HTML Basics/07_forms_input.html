    <!-- The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button. In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data: -->

    <form action="process.php">
      <!-- Text -->
      <div>
        <!-- The for attribute specifies which form element a label is bound to. -->
        <!-- in the for attribute passing in the id of the input will cause the input box to highlight in user clicks on label -->
        <label for="name">Name</label><br />
        <!-- on the input it is the name attribute that communicates what is input to the server side code -->
        <!-- The name attribute specifies the name of an <input> element.The name attribute is used to reference elements in a JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.Note: Only form elements with a name attribute will have their values passed when submitting a form. -->
        <!-- the value attribute will pre fill the box with the value John Doe it needs to be either deleted by user or removed with javascript  , HTML 5 has placeholder it will not be the value submitted with the form but just be an example   -->
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="John Doe" />
      </div>
      <!-- Email -->
      <div>
        <label for="email">Email</label><br />
        <!-- type email check  if email -->
        <!-- The <input type="email"> defines a field for an e-mail address.The input value is automatically validated to ensure it is a properly formatted e-mail address.To define an e-mail field that allows multiple e-mail addresses, add the "multiple" attribute. -->
        <input
          type="email"
          name="email"
          id="email"
          placeholder="Enter an email"
        />
      </div>
      <!-- Textarea -->
      <div>
        <label for="message">Message</label><br />
        <!-- a textarea is like text but bigger and can make even bigger by passing in colums and rows  -->
        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="50" rows="5"></textarea>
      </div>
      <!-- Select -->
      <div>
        <label for="sex">Sex</label>
        <!-- select and options tags make a drop down menu -->
        <!-- The <select> element is used to create a drop-down list. The <select> element is most often used in a form, to collect user input. The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted). The id attribute is needed to associate the drop-down list with a label. The <option> tags inside the <select> element define the available options in the drop-down list. Tip: Always add the <label> tag for best accessibility practices! -->
        <select name="sex" id="sex">
          <option value="male">Male</option>
          <!-- the selected attribute here will pre select that value when page loads -->

      <!-- Radio -->
      <!-- Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups (a collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options). Only one radio button in a group can be selected at the same time.
        Note: The radio group must have share the same name (the value of the name attribute) to be treated as a group. Once the radio group is created, selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any other selected radio button in the same group. You can have as many radio groups on a page as you want, as long as each group has its own name.
        Note: The value attribute defines the unique value associated with each radio button. The value is not shown to the user, but is the value that is sent to the server on "submit" to identify which radio button that was selected. -->

        <input type="radio" name="membership" value="simple" id="membership" />
